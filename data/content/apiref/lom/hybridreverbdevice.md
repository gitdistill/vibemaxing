# HybridReverbDevice
This class represents an instance of a Hybrid Reverb device in Live.   
A HybridReverbDevice has all the properties, functions and children of a Device. Listed below are members unique to HybridReverbDevice.
## Properties
### ir_attack_time float observe
The attack time of the amplitude envelope for the impulse response, in seconds.
### ir_category_index int observe
The index of the selected impulse response category.
### ir_category_list StringVector read-only
The list of impulse response categories.
### ir_decay_time float observe
The decay time of the amplitude envelope for the impulse response, in seconds.
### ir_file_index int observe
The index of the selected impulse response files from the current category.
### ir_file_list StringVector read-onlyobserve
The list of impulse response files from the selected category.
### ir_size_factor float observe
The relative size of the impulse response, 0.0 to 1.0.
### ir_time_shaping_on bool observe
Enables transforming the current selected impulse response with an amplitude envelope and size parameter.   
1 = enabled.
