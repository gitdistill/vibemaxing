When disabled, the scene will use the song's tempo,   
and the tempo value returned will be -1.
### time_signature_numerator int observe
The scene's time signature numerator.   
Returns -1 if the scene time signature is disabled.
### time_signature_denominator int observe
The scene's time signature denominator.   
Returns -1 if the scene time signature is disabled.

## Functions
### fire
Parameter: `force_legato (optional)` [bool]   
`can_select_scene_on_launch (optional)` [bool]   
Fire all clip slots contained within the scene and select this scene.   
Starts recording of armed and empty tracks within a Group Track in this scene if Preferences->Launch->Start Recording on Scene Launch is ON.   
Calling with force_legato = 1 (default = 0) will launch all clips immediately in Legato, independent of their launch mode.   
When calling with can_select_scene_on_launch = 0 (default = 1) the scene is fired without selecting it.
### fire_as_selected
Parameter: `force_legato (optional)` [bool]   
Fire the selected scene, then select the next scene.   
It doesn't matter on which scene you are calling this function.   
Calling with force_legato = 1 (default = 0) will launch all clips immediately in Legato, independent of their launch mode.
### set_fire_button_state
Parameter: `state` [bool]   
If the state is set to 1, Live simulates pressing of scene button until the state is set to 0 or until the scene is stopped otherwise.
